## Introduction

I have never, I mean never, written anything about me or my projects on a blog or done anything that resembles logging/journaling. I thought it would be a nice exercise to try and log once a week what I do and how I feel during this year abroad.

During this year I have to develop with my team, a PSX emulator for our final year project so I'll often write about its advancements, difficulties and achievements (I guess)

## Who am I ?

First of all, Hello World!

I'm Sacha and I'm a 23 year-old computer science student in France. I currently am doing an exchange program in Deagu, South Korea. I arrived here in late August so its already been a full 2 months I've been living in Korea.

I have been studying CS since 2021 at EPITECH, and so far it's been awesome. I learned so many new things about programming, new technologies and project management but I also made new friends which I am here in Daegu with! These 3 years have been really great, with its deal of ups and downs due to poor organization skills from my part. I try to learn form my mistakes so hopefully I improved over time since then :) Now that I have a **VERY** ambitious project to work on and present at the end of this school year, I decided I wanted to get revenge on my past self and properly manage this project and work efficiently on it. It's a bit scary I'm not going to lie because I never really worked at 100% on something before so this is very new to me.

Now you know me a little better :smile:

## What will I write about ?

As you may have already guessed, about my projects (mostly about the PSX emulator which I have absolutely no idea how to kickstart), programming, my new discoveries, and mostly tech stuff...

But I'll also write about my experience abroad here in Daegu, South Korea, some of the things that happen in my daily life, challenges I face, and some tips I learned while living in Korea.

> I you have any suggestions or ideas about a subject or aspects of programming/software developing or anything else you want ot hear about really don't hesitate to tell me, I'll be happy to talk about it.

## Some pictures I took of Daegu between September and November

_The weather is really unpredictable! It can heavily rain in just 5 minutes and then let the sun appear soon later_

## Conclusion

That's pretty much everything I have to write about for today and I hope I'll have plenty of ideas and things to talk about here!

That being said I hope I see you next time!

**Sacha** :)
